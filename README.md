To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd quizmaster
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary Python dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Initialize the database and run migrations**:

      * Ensure Alembic is configured (if used).
      * Run migrations to create tables and fields, including the new difficulty, time, and color fields for `QuizPack`:
        ```bash
        flask db migrate -m "Add difficulty, time, and color to QuizPack"
        flask db upgrade
        ```
      * If you're using `init_database.py` to create initial data, ensure it's updated to populate these new fields.

## Admin Panel

QuizMaster includes a powerful admin panel for convenient content management.

### How to Access the Admin Panel:

1.  Register a new user or log in with an existing account.
2.  In the current implementation, **any registered user has access to the admin panel**. In a real-world project, a robust role-based access control system (e.g., checking `current_user.is_admin`) should be implemented here.
3.  Navigate to the URL: [http://localhost:5000/admin](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:5000/admin)

### Adding and Managing Packs:

From the admin panel, you can:

  * **Create new quiz packs**: Specify the title, description, **color**, **difficulty level**, and **estimated completion time**.
  * **Edit existing quiz packs**: Modify their data.
  * **Add, edit, and delete questions** for each quiz pack.
  * **Delete entire quiz packs**, which also removes all associated questions and user statistics for that pack.
